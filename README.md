## ZMK Firmware for the dotKeeb

This uses colemak-dh for the base alphas, and also communicates with a QMK trackball (the ploopy nano) to handle automatic mouse layers. This isn't a final keymap and I still make tweaks to it often

My main goals while creating this keymap were to:
- Make sure there aren't any keystrokes or actions that are impossible, or rely on timing.
- Minimize discomfort
- Minimize complexity

### Trackball support
If you wish to use this with the ploopy nano trackball, you'll need to flash it with the `lkbm` keymap.
